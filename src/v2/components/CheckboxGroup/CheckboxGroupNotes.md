## When to use
- When a user can select any number of choices from a set list.
- When applicants need to see all the available options at a glance.

## When to consider something different
- If there are too many options to display on a mobile screen.
- If a user can only select one option from a list (use radio buttons instead).

## Guidance
- Applicants should be able to tap on or click on either the text label or the checkbox to select or deselect an option.
- Avoid using negative language in labels as they can be counterintuitive. For example, “I want to receive a promotional email” instead of “I don’t want to receive promotional email.”
